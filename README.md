# Personalized Attire Recommendation Engine

This repository contains the code for a Personalized Attire Recommendation Engine, designed to suggest clothing based on various personal attributes, potentially including gender and skin color. The project aims to provide a more tailored and relevant attire recommendation experience.


## Features

Based on the file names, this project appears to include the following core functionalities:

* *Skin Color Detection:* Analyzes skin tone, potentially to suggest attire colors or styles that complement it.
* *Data Scraping:* Tools to collect data, possibly images or product information, from external sources.
* *Recommendation Model:* A core machine learning model responsible for generating personalized attire suggestions.
* *Image Processing:* Utilities for handling and processing images, crucial for gender and skin color detection, and potentially for attire analysis.

## Technologies Used

This project is primarily developed in Python and likely utilizes the following libraries and frameworks:

* *Python 3.x*
* *Machine Learning Libraries:* (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn) for model development.
* *Image Processing:* (e.g., OpenCV, PIL/Pillow) for handling image data.
* *Web Scraping:* (e.g., Beautiful Soup, Requests) for data collection.
* *Data Manipulation:* (e.g., NumPy, Pandas) for data handling.


## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  *Clone the repository:*
    bash
    git clone [https://github.com/swar16/Personalized-Attire-Recommendation-Engine.git](https://github.com/swar16/Personalized-Attire-Recommendation-Engine.git)
    cd Personalized-Attire-Recommendation-Engine
    

2.  *Create a virtual environment (recommended):*
    bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    

3.  *Install dependencies:*
    
    bash
    pip install tensorflow opencv-python scikit-learn beautifulsoup4 requests numpy pandas
    

## Usage

The general workflow for using this engine would likely involve:

1.  *Data Collection:* Run the scraper.py script to gather attire data from online sources.
    bash
    python scraper.py
    

2.  *Model Training:* Train the recommendation model using the collected data. This would likely involve model.py.
    bash
    python model.py
    
    (This script would handle data preprocessing, model architecture definition, and training.)

3.  *Gender and Skin Color Detection:* 
    bash
    # Example (actual usage might vary based on implementation)
    python gender.py --image_path "path/to/user_image.jpg"
    python skin_color_detector.py --image_path "path/to/user_image.jpg"
    

4.  *Generate Recommendations:* Integrate the detection modules with the trained model to provide personalized attire recommendations. The model_image.py might be involved in this process, potentially for visual output.
    bash
    # Example (actual usage would depend on the main application logic)
    python run_recommendation_engine.py --user_image "path/to/user_image.jpg"
